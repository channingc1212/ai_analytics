# AI Data Analyst Project Configuration

# Project Description
This is an AI-powered data analysis tool built with LangChain, Streamlit, and OpenAI.
The project aims to provide automated data analysis and insights generation through an interactive web interface.

# Code Style Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable names that reflect their purpose
